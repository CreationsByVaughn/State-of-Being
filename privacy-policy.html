  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Effective Date: July 27, 2025</p>

  <p>Thank you for using <strong>State of Being</strong>. Your privacy is very important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in our app.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <p>
    We do not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information (PII). 
    All data you enter into the app — including your mood, energy, emotions, journal entries, and goals — is stored locally on your device only. 
    We have no access to this data.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Local Data Storage</h2>
  <p>
    All personal entries and information remain on your device. If you choose to back up your device using iCloud, Google Drive, or another service, your data may be included in that backup, 
    but we do not access or control those backups.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Purchases and Subscriptions</h2>
  <p>
    Our app uses <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RevenueCat</a> to manage in-app purchases and subscriptions. 
    RevenueCat may collect anonymous purchase-related information (e.g., purchase receipts) to verify transactions. 
    This data is not personally identifiable to us and is used solely for validating your purchase and subscription status.
  </p>

  <h2>4. No Third-Party Tracking</h2>
  <p>
    We do not use analytics, advertising trackers, or other third-party tracking technologies.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Our app is not designed to knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13. 
    Because we do not collect personal data, there is no risk of sharing such information.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. 
    Any changes will be posted on this page with the updated effective date.
  </p>
